GIS Subject 
This is a GIS project during my Masters Course in Rutgers University. This project aims towards understanding the Tourism industry in the New York City, its reliance on Subway network, Historical relations to the present setting of the city. On top of these inferences, the project is to create a user-friendly interface which helps the tourist to identify all the must-visit tourist attractions as they specify ther latitude, longitude and the radius of exploration from their origin coordinates.
